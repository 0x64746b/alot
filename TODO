Sending mails
  * an Envelope buffer that contains widgets for recipients,subject, gpg settings.
  * A "SendManager" that can send and archive (in a maildir send folder), 
    loads the mail into the notmuch index and maybe refreshes open buffers accordingly

searchbuffer: 
  * unseen tag -> msg bold
  * focus next thread after toggletag. It would be easyest if IteratorWalker had a focus_next()
    that could be called in ToggleTagCommand in case thread is still in the searchresults

singleThread buffer:
  * what if depth>screensize?
  * proper display of email body
  * open unread mails? focus first unread/query matched?

Commands
  * help strings in commands and help buffer
  * undo for commands

taglist buffer
  * interactively filter tagcloud
    this will have to wait until a version of urwid can be easy_installed in that GridFlow
    has a get_focus: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.urwid/971

db:
  * db.Message.get_replies() needs fixing. see 
    http://notmuch.198994.n3.nabble.com/python-get-all-messages-of-a-thread-tt2996080.html

ui
  It would be cool if we had a cmdline like vim or mutt when pressing ":".
  Commands already have typenames, calling them from a prompt could
  use the command.factory to build one and pass it to ui.apply_command.
  see http://wiki.python.org/moin/CmdModule i thinks its a good idea to separate
  prompt-commands from alot.command commands, for example for a undo-function..
  however, ui.prompt could easily use this. possible cmds:
  search (short \ or o), refine (| or O), print, save, view attachments?, pipe
  should these cmds have output? where to put it? see pentadactyl.

general
  * gg, g5j.. combos like in vim
  * pydoc/sphinx
  * handle errors with nonexisting mime handlers (mailcap) 


far away future:
  * addressbook manager with backends for lbdb,abook,rolo that can be used for prompt autocompletion
