  * refresh open buffers accordingly

envelope buffer:
  * needs ability do display/edit attachments
  * full headers via a MessageHeadersWidget with displayed=None
  * enter -> editor
  * gpg settings per widget, should read defaults from account settings

searchbuffer: 
  * unseen tag -> msg bold
  * focus next thread after toggletag. It would be easyest if IteratorWalker had a focus_next()
    that could be called in ToggleTagCommand in case thread is still in the searchresults

singleThread buffer:
  * what if depth>screensize?
  * proper display of email body: fold stuff
  * open unread mails? focus first unread/query matched?

Commands
  * help strings in commands and help buffer
  * undo for commands

taglist buffer
  * interactively filter tagcloud
    this will have to wait until a version of urwid can be easy_installed in that GridFlow
    has a get_focus: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.urwid/971

db:
  * db.Message.get_replies() needs fixing. see 
    http://notmuch.198994.n3.nabble.com/python-get-all-messages-of-a-thread-tt2996080.html
  * retry flushing after a timeout

ui.commandline:
  possible cmds:
  map,search (short \ or o), refine (| or O), print, save, view attachments?, pipe
  should these cmds have output? where to put it? see pentadactyl.

ui:
  * current bindings in header like mutt?


general
  * gg, g5j.. combos like in vim
  * pydoc/sphinx
  * handle errors with nonexisting mime handlers (mailcap) 
  * update dependencies in setup.py:
   cmd
   subprocess?
   threading?
   mailbox
   mailcap


distant future:
  * addressbook manager with backends for lbdb,abook,rolo that can be used for prompt autocompletion
