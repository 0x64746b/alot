Sending mails
  * an Envelope buffer that contains widgets for recipients,subject, gpg settings.
  * A "SendManager" that can send and archive (in a maildir send folder), 
    loads the mail into the notmuch index and maybe refreshes open buffers accordingly

configuration
  * use offlineimaps LocalEval approach to load colour palette/hooks

searchbuffer: 
  * unseen tag -> msg bold
  * focus next thread after toggletag. It would be easyest if IteratorWalker had a focus_next()
    that could be called in ToggleTagCommand in case thread is still in the searchresults

Commands
  * help strings in commands and help buffer
  * undo for commands

taglist buffer
  * interactively filter tagcloud
    this will have to wait until a version of urwid can be easy_installed in that GridFlow
    has a get_focus: http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.urwid/971

db:
  * db.Message.get_replies() needs fixing. see 
    http://notmuch.198994.n3.nabble.com/python-get-all-messages-of-a-thread-tt2996080.html

ui
  It would be cool if we had a cmdline like vim or mutt when pressing ":".
  Commands already have typenames, calling them from a prompt could
  use the command.factory to build one and pass it to ui.apply_command.


general
  * gg, g5j.. combos like in vim
  * pydoc/sphinx


far away future:
  * addressbook manager with backends for lbdb,abook,rolo that can be used for prompt autocompletion
