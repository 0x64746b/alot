This is a proposal for a terminal gui for notmuch mail, written in python.
You can find some old screenshots in data/alot*png
Stay tuned for a more up-to-date description of the architecture and a usage intro,
I intend to clean up a bit, include a few more features and release a first version soonâ„¢.

Current features include:
 * spawn terminals for asynchronous editing of mails
 * theming, optionally in monochromatic, 16 or 256 colours
 * tag specific theming and tagstring translation
 * a hook system to inject ones own python code
 * python shell for introspection
 * forward/reply/group-reply of emails
 * multiple accounts for sending mails via sendmail
 * tab completion for commands and querystrings
 * priorizable notification popups
 * database manager that manages a write queue to the notmuch index
 * user configurable keyboard maps

Soonish to be addresses non-features:
 * encryption/decryption for messages
 * search for strings in displayed buffer
 * print command
 * folding for message parts
 * undo for commands
 * addressbook integration
